    %h1 Call for Papers

    %h2{title: "Why"} Why
    %p
      A conference like RubyConf Argentina is all about new ideas, getting a renewed perspective on old topics, encouraging discussion and getting to know new people. Having a good roster of already established, well-known speakers is not enough to guarantee that.
      %span We want you to jump on stage
      and show everyone what you have - maybe you created a new library, or have an idea worth exploring, or want to share some of your experiences.
    %p
      In fact, we believe so much that new faces are to be on the spotlight of a conference, that we go to great lengths in making selected speakers comfortable so they can rock the stage. Stay tunned for more announcements!
